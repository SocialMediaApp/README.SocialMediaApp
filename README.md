# README.SocialMediaApp

Welcome to my social media app project. In summary I created this project with the goal of demonstrating and practicing my web development skills. 

### Why

I chose to create a simple social media app so that I could have a single consistent app to create accross multiple frameworks. I also felt that a social media app offers me the chance to demonstrate a number of different features.

### Features

The features that I want to demonstrate with these apps are the following:

* Authentication
    * Login
    * Logout
    * Create Account
    * Login/Create Account from Google
    * Forgot Password (Maybe)
* Profile
    * Add/Update some basic information
    * Upload a profile picture
* Friends
    * Search
    * Add
    * Remove
    * Permissions on friends pages
    * Suggested friends (building a map)
* News Feed
    * Observables for realtime data
    * Up/Downvotes
    * Infinite scroll (Paging)
* Chat
    * Socket.io for realtime chatting
    
### Issues
    
If you do stumble accross these apps and notice any defects or best practice problems, please let me know by opening a github issue. I would really appreciate it!
    
### Licence

You can use this for anything and everything you want to use it for.
